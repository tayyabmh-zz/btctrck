These are the resources you are going to need.

I always do a resources file, that tracks all of my library APIs or like simple algorithms on shit here. Also, remember to create a branch before you start writing code.

1. React - https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html

2. Redux (You will need this eventually but honestly don't worry about this yet) - http://redux.js.org/

3. I'm assuming you know how to use NPM

4. Create-React-App is a good beginner tool to use. For when we start creating the app itself - https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

5. D3.js - https://d3js.org/

6. Coinbase API - https://developers.coinbase.com/
